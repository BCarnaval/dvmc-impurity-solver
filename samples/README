# How to run the example:

In any sub directories (except chain2_U8), generate all the input files using 
the command (inside the directories):

$ preprocess_dVMC.sh

After that, you can submit the job to a supercomputer with command like

$ qsub ./run_vmc.sh

This file is optimized for sekirei (issp) for now, but can be adapted for any
computer with lapacke or mkl. with this specific file, it takes under 20 minutes
to run. This will generate Monte Carlo sampling binary files in the output directory.
You can automatically postprocess the Monte Carlo samples to generate the A(k,w) plots
simply by typing:

$ postprocess_dVMC.sh

# Result:

If everything works, the figure "akw_all.pdf"
shown if "expected_Akw" should be produced when typing the command:

$ gnuplot plot_allAkw.gp


# Details:

The two scripts preprocess_dVMC.sh and postprocess_dVMC.sh do a bunch of
automatizations in order to make the examples contained in the "./samples/"
subdirectories easy to run. In general it can be used for other geometries
and parameters, but at this point the user might want to know more about
the details of the implementation. Here is a short description:

# preprocess_dVMC.sh:

Generate all the input files for the Monte Carlo sampling procedure to run.
The main task added to the already present dvmcdry.out is a function
that generate the excitation.def file, called makeExcitation.py. This
python function takes the definitions in spectrumpara.def to define the
neighbor charge positions. In "spectrumpara.def" this last file, 
the values "dr1_x, dr1_y, dr2_x, dr2_y", defines the 
difference in position of the charge excitation relatif to site "i" or 
"j" of the operator "c^dagger_i" or  "c_j" for the Green function 
<n|c^dagger_i cj|m>. For example:

"
dr1_x       -1:2      # will generate array [-1,0,1,2]
dr1_y       -1:2      # will generate array [-1,0,1,2]
dr2_x       -1:2      # will generate array [-1,0,1,2]
dr2_y       -1:2      # will generate array [-1,0,1,2]
"

will generate all the allowed combination of the four vector described.
This will result in 377 different charge-charge excitations in the file
"excitation.def". Perhaps futur user will want to 
change this part, and possibly add different kind of excitation. If so, 
this script will also need to be adapted. The number on the far left
is the type of excitation. It is directly related to the types defined
in "src/mVMC/calgrn.c" file. Each type (with position differences) 
define a commutation relation with c^dagger and c. To 


# running dvmc.out

preprocessing wil generate all the necessary files and configuration.
However, make sure that you have enough memory for the calculation. 
Running the program print you an estimate of the memory necessary for
the calculation. For example:

"This mpi thread requires a little above 3.2847 Go." 

On many multi-cpu core, you have the choice to use your
CPUs with either OpenMP or mpi. Note that using every CPU with MPI
duplicate the memory. You will generate more sample (better statistic)
this way. Using all the CPUs with OpenMP will reduce the memory usage
and make the code execute faster by the factor $OMP_NUM_THREADS. 
Usually, it is suggested to use MPI only for many core calculation, 
and to use every CPU of the core with OpenMP, by setting:

$ export MKL_NUM_THREADS=1
$ export OMP_NUM_THREADS=24


# postprocess_dVMC.sh
#
# mergeOutputBin.py output/zvo_nCHAm_nAHCm_0*.bin
Merge all the binary files 'output/zvo_nCHAm_nAHCm_***.bin' in order to
reduce the Monte Carlo noise and convert the result in an numpy array of
floats in order to reduce the memory on hard drive.

#dvmc_spectrum.py spectrumpara.def output
From this averaging, the task "dvmc_spectrum.py" is used to calculate the
full spectrum Akw_all.dat and the dos.dat. 

These two tasks alone are sufficient to generate the necessary data.
After that, the remaining tasks in this script are used to slice the
Akw_all.dat file into a kPath defined in spectrumpara.def, calculate
chemical potential from dos integration, adjust and create gnuplot
plotting file from template and parameters.

It is encouraged to look at the content of "preprocess_dVMC.sh" 
and "postprocess_dVMC.sh" (in ~/bin/. directory, or in tool/dvmc/.)
as there is more comments to be found that details every task, and show
how to call the different tasks.


# Notes

1. During the treatment of "dvmc_spectrum.py" you should read
a step printing:

 12/16  --   3/ 2   2/ 2 :           ∫dw A(k11,w)  =  0.99026

  correction factor:                ∫∫dw dk A(k,w) =  0.99022 

Note here that the number on the right is the sum rule. In theory
this sum rule should be exactly one (if your frequency integration
was done from -inf < w < inf). But the fact that this integral is not
exactly one is not only due to an integration imprecision and
the finite range of integration, it is a also
good indicator of the convergence of the method. If this number is 
significantly (more than ~2 percent) different than 1.000, 
probably that the parameter chosen are wrong (energy window or 
number of Monte Carlo sampling or bad ground state found). There is a
lot of different cause that can make this sum rule wrong. Having 
a result around 0.99 is a necessary (but not always sufficient) to 
obtain a converged result. In some cases, for big clusters (8x8 or
12x12), this need to be checked at every iteration (for every bin file), and 
keep the number of sample per iteration relativly low, as some sample seems 
to create bad statistic. For now, no automatic processing of this 
statistic is included in the code, and it must be checked with the function
filter_bin.sh. This will print on screen which bin file does not
respect a sumrule 0.96 < int dw A(k,w) 1.01 for every k points. 
For this reason, care must be take if you run the example in the
directory "12x12_U8_Ne126", or any big cluster. It is simple to 
exclude any file where the sum rule is not respected. 

2. Some examples shown in this directory start from a random guess for
the ground state determination. This may be sufficient or good for small
cluster in certain case. But keep in mind that in the general case, on 
bigger model (bigger than 16 sites), care must be taken to correctly
determine the ground state properly before proceeding to the sampling
of the spectral weight A(k,w).

3. An undersampled A(k,w) will result in a similar error than
an unconverged ground state. Both steps are importants.

4. On a big computed cluster, you need to edit properly the header 
of "run_vmc.sh" befor submitting:

5. It is better to avoid to include the postprocessing
in the cluster submission as it can take several minutes
and it is not parallelized.

6. This example also require gnuplot installed to plot Akw_all.dat.
But Akw_all.dat could be plot with any software and script at this point.

7. Although, some generic parameters might need to be adjusted to obtain a 
good result (axis label). Gnuplot is the software of choice here because 
it can embed an image of the A(k,w), resulting in smaller file, faster 
to process and easier to scroll by in a PDF file.
