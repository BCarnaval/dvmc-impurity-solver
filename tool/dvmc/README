## README

Most of the program provided here are stand alone tools necessary to
prepare the inputs or analyse the output of dvmc.out code. The most
important are:

preprocess_dVMC.sh           can be called before running dvmc.out
postprocess_dVMC.sh          can be called after running dvmc.out

They both contain all the other tool to be called in order to prepare
and process the examples provided in samples/spectrum subdirectories.

Some other tools are provided. Here is a small description for the most
useful functions. (To use them, type the function and the default usage
will be printed). Note that you must first do make to obtain all the
necessary dependencies. The makefile is simple, but requires either
lapack or mkl linking.

######################
in preprocess_dVMC.sh:
######################
makeExcitation.py
  --> tool to generate excitation.def used by dvmc.out with NVMCCalMode == 3 (dVMC mode)


#######################
in postprocess_dVMC.sh:
#######################
mergeOutputBin.py
  --> tool to merge different binary file with name zvo_nCHAm_nAHCm_***.bin and output a 4 python ready 4D array of size(N_exc,N_exc,W,L)

dvmc_spectrum.py
  --> main postprocessing tool to calculate the spectrum (Akw.dat, etc.)

generate_template_gnuplot.py
  --> copy and adapt the three template file to be used with gnuplot (some adaptation must be done, like inputing mu offset)

dos_analysis.py
  --> tool to calculate LHB and UHB.

select_kPath.py spectrumpara.def
  --> tool to select a subset of k points in the files Akw_all.dat


#######################
others
#######################
selectExcitation.py
  --> tool to select a subset of excitation. This generate a string that can be inputed in spectrumpara.def

gnupy
  --> tool to make pretty figure from gnuplot and latex

init_groundstate.py
  --> tool to find a starting ground state in 2D lattice Hubbard model (useful for big clusters)

makeDH4.py
  --> tool created by Takafumi Suzuki to find the input file for DH4 files

dvmc_gnuplot
  --> tool to visualize interactivly in real time the Akw_all.dat file.
      This file must be computed with dvmc_spectrum.py before.

      call with:
      dvmc_gnuplot Nx Ny Nw NFermi cbar_max
      Nx = integer (number of points in x).
      Ny = integer (number of points in y).
      Nw = integer (number of frequency calculated, number of lines in Akw_all.dat).
      NFermi = integer (frame to start on, frame closest to the Fermi level).
      cbar_max = float (value of the maximum value in the intensity plot, colorbar).

cluster.py
  --> simple tool to create a square array of numbers.

zvo_var_average.py
  --> tool to average the last iterations (last N lines) of zvo_var_001.dat

select_kPath_average.py
  --> similar to select_kPath.py but average multiple paths togheter.

selectExcitation.py
  --> select excitations that are smaller than a threshold in the already calculated excitations (generate a string of number to be put in spectrumpara.dat)

makeFullGreen.py
  --> generate full green functions by defining full greenone.def and greentwo.def

makeGreenOhgoe.py
  --> generate green functions necessary to run averageOhgoe.py (in greenone.def and greentwo.def)

averageOhgoe.py
  --> function created by Takahiro Ohgoe and adapted to calculate various physical quantities like AFM order, density and superconducting fluidity.


LICENSE:

By default, the same license as the one in the root directory, unless otherwise specified.
Indeed, a lot of source code here borrow some portion to already published code under the zlib
license. So we need to repeat the zlib LICENSE in the header of these functions. However,
this is compatible with the GNU license of the root directory since zlib is very permissive.
